# Blinkit-Dashboard

This is a Power BI project that visualizes sales and outlet data for Blinkit — India’s quick-commerce grocery delivery platform. The dashboard highlights key metrics such as total sales, number of items, average sales, and average rating.

## Problem Statement
As Blinkit rapidly expands its quick-commerce operations across multiple Indian cities, the management faces challenges in monitoring sales trends, product performance, and outlet efficiency across different regions and outlet types. Without a centralized visual analytics tool, decision-makers lack clarity on:

- Which product categories drive the most revenue
- How fat content or item types affect sales
- The impact of outlet size, location tier, and type on performance
- Trends in outlet establishment over the years
- Customer rating patterns and sales visibility across formats

This Power BI dashboard aims to solve this problem by delivering a dynamic, filterable, and data-rich interface for executives to make quick, data-driven decisions around outlet performance, product strategy, and market expansion.
